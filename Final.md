## Overview

For the final, you and a group of two to three people will work on a substantive independent NLP project. You will make both a final poster, to present your research to others in the class and the community during a showcase, and a final paper. More details on this to come later.

You will work on the project in five phases. You can read about the pedagogical motivation for each of those phases in [our paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.teachingnlp-1.16/). 

## Phase one: Thinking through an idea (on your own)

First, you will work-through (at some level of detail) a project idea on your own. This should be something you are interested in, regardless of who you might work with in the end. You will submit an individual project idea building on a google doc template. Add a shortcut to your doc in the shared folder (you need to be logged in to your Colgate email) linked below. Make sure to add your name to the file!

## Phase two: Pilot proposal + feedback (in a group)

Work with your group to come up with a project proposal. Submit this to gradescope.

## Phase three: Pilot results presentation (in a group)

Each group will present your pilot results for 5 minutes. Your presentation should include the following components.  

* Broad goal and the specific question you are looking at in the project. (1 minute)

* An *overview* of the methods you use. What data are you using? What is the **sequence of steps** you took to go from a dataset to a results table/figure? (2 minutes) 

* Current state of your results + any other experiments you plan to run for the final project. You should have at least one figure or table. (2 minutes)

After each presentation, there will be 2 minutes of questions/feedback from your peers.
